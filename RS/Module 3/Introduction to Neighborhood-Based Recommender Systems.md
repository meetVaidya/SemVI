Neighborhood-based recommendation is a **collaborative filtering approach** that makes personalized recommendations by analyzing past user interactions.

- **Collaborative Filtering** works on the assumption that users who have behaved similarly in the past will have similar preferences in the future.
    
- These systems rely on the idea that:
    
    - **Users with similar behavior have similar interests.**
        
    - **Items that receive attention from similar users are related.**
        

### **How Does It Work?**

1. The system collects user-item interaction data (e.g., movie ratings, product purchases).
    
2. It computes **similarity scores** between users or items.
    
3. Based on these similarities, the system recommends items that similar users have liked or that are similar to previously interacted items.
