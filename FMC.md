**1) Functions of Money**

Based on the provided documents, money serves several core functions in an economy:

- **Medium of Exchange:** Money facilitates transactions by acting as a common intermediary. It eliminates the inefficiencies of the barter system, where trade requires a double coincidence of wants. For example, a baker can sell bread for money and use that money to buy groceries.
    
- **Unit of Account:** Money provides a standard numerical measure for pricing goods and services. It allows businesses and individuals to compare the value of different items. For example, a car priced at $20,000 and a watch priced at $500 reflect their relative value.
    
- **Store of Value:** Money retains purchasing power over time, enabling savings and accumulation of wealth. While inflation may erode its value, money remains a practical store for wealth compared to perishable goods.
    
- **Standard of Deferred Payment:** Money facilitates credit transactions by serving as an agreed-upon measure to settle future obligations. For example, loans and mortgages are paid back in money over time.
